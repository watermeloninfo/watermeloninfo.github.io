# Advanced Degree

## Master or PhD
Prepare the following:
- A copy of the diploma.
- A copy of transcripts from the highest degree earned.

**Note:** Keep the documents concise to avoid confusing the officer. If the degree was earned outside of the US, a credential evaluation report is required. If a doctoral degree is customarily required, you must have a United States doctorate or its foreign equivalent degree.

## Credential Evaluation for Foreign Degrees
If the degree was earned from universities outside of the US, provide a credential evaluation report for the highest degree relevant to the application.

**Key Points:**
- USCIS does not endorse any specific agency.
- A course-by-course evaluation is not required; a general evaluation suffices, showing the equivalency of the foreign degree to a US degree.

### Recommended Evaluation Agencies
1. **WES (World Education Services):**
   - One of the most recognized credential evaluation services in the U.S.
   - Trusted by universities, employers, and licensing boards.
   - Known for precise evaluations of international degrees.

   **For Chinese applicants:**  
   WES only accepts certifications authenticated by 学信网 (CHSI). Complete the CHSI certification first and then submit it to WES. This usually takes 1-2 weeks, although processing times during holidays may be longer.

2. **FIS (Foreign Credential Services of America):**
   - Offers a more affordable and simpler process.
   - Provides translation services.

# Exceptional Ability

## Two-Step Test

### Step 1: Evidence Types
The petitioner must meet at least 3 out of the 6 evidence types:

1. **Academic Record**  
   An official academic record showing that the beneficiary has a degree, diploma, certificate, or similar award from a college, university, school, or other institution of learning relating to the area of exceptional ability.

2. **Experience**  
   Evidence in the form of letter(s) from current or former employer(s) showing that the beneficiary has at least 10 years of full-time experience in the occupation in which they are being sought.

3. **Licenses or Certifications**  
   A license to practice the profession or certification for a particular profession or occupation.

4. **Salary or Remuneration**  
   Evidence that the beneficiary has commanded a salary or other remuneration for services that demonstrates exceptional ability.  
   *Note:* The evidence must show that the salary or remuneration is indicative of exceptional ability relative to others in the field.

5. **Membership in Professional Associations**  
   Evidence of membership in professional associations.

6. **Recognition for Achievements**  
   Evidence of recognition for achievements and significant contributions to the industry or field by peers, governmental entities, or professional or business organizations.

*Note:* Affidavits can be provided to demonstrate qualifications. In some cases, evidence relevant to one criterion may be applicable to other criteria.

### Step 2: Final Merits Determination
Meeting the minimum requirement of providing at least three types of initial evidence does not, in itself, establish that the beneficiary qualifies for exceptional ability classification. The officer must review the evidence as a whole to determine whether the petitioner meets the burden of proof.

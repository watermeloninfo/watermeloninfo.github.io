# National Importance

## First Prong: The Proposed Endeavor has both Substantial Merit and National Importance

### Endeavor
The term “endeavor” is more specific than the general occupation; a petitioner should offer details not only as to what the occupation normally involves, but what types of work the person proposes to undertake specifically within that occupation.

For example, while engineering is an occupation, the explanation of the proposed endeavor should describe the specific projects and goals, or the areas of engineering in which the person will work, rather than simply listing the duties and responsibilities of an engineer.

### Substantial Merit
The endeavor’s merit may be demonstrated in areas including, but not limited to, business, entrepreneurship, science, technology, culture, health, or education.

USCIS values evidence of the endeavor’s potential significant economic impact, but:
- **Merit may be established without immediate or quantifiable economic impact.**
- **Endeavors related to research, pure science, and the furtherance of human knowledge may qualify, whether or not the potential accomplishments in those fields are likely to translate into economic benefits for the United States.**

Endeavors such as classroom teaching, for example, without broader implications for a field or region, generally do not rise to the level of having national importance for the purpose of establishing eligibility for a national interest waiver.

**Note:** This is a highly subjective standard. The petitioner should focus on discussing the endeavor and its national importance.

---

### National Importance
Officers must also examine the national importance of the specific endeavor proposed by considering its potential prospective impact.

Officers should focus on the nature of the proposed endeavor, rather than only the geographic breadth of the endeavor. For example, the endeavor:
- **May have national importance because it has national or even global implications within a particular field, such as certain improved manufacturing processes or medical advances.**
- Economically, it may have **“significant potential to employ U.S. workers”** or **“other substantial positive economic effects, particularly in an economically depressed area.”**

Petitioners should submit a detailed description explaining the proposed endeavor and supporting documentary evidence to establish that the endeavor is of national importance.

Ultimately, if the evidence demonstrates that the person’s proposed endeavor has the **significant potential to broadly enhance societal welfare or cultural or artistic enrichment**, or to **contribute to the advancement of a valuable technology or field of study**, it may rise to the level of national importance.

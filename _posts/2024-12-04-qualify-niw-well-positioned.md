# Well Positioned

## Second Prong: The Person is Well Positioned to Advance the Proposed Endeavor

Unlike the first prong, which focuses on the merit and importance of the proposed endeavor, the second prong centers on the person. The person needs to be “well positioned to advance the endeavor.”

---

### Factors: (not an exclusive list)

- The person’s education, skills, knowledge, and record of success in related or similar efforts;
- A model or plan that the person developed, or played a significant role in developing, for future activities related to the proposed endeavor;
- Any progress towards achieving the proposed endeavor; and
- The interest or support garnered by the person from potential customers, users, investors, or other relevant entities or persons.

The petitioner should submit evidence to document the person’s past achievements and corroborate projections related to the proposed endeavor. 

Claims cannot be unsubstantiated or implausible, but does not need to demonstrate that the proposed endeavor is more likely than not to ultimately succeed.

---

### Examples of evidence: (not exclusive list)

- Degrees, certificates, or licenses in the field;
- Patents, trademarks, or copyrights developed by the person;
- Letters from experts in the person’s field, describing the person’s past achievements and providing specific examples of how the person is well positioned to advance the person’s endeavor;
- Published articles or media reports about the person’s achievements or current work;
- Documentation demonstrating a strong citation history of the person’s work or excerpts of published articles showing positive discourse around, or adoption of, the person’s work;
- Evidence that the person’s work has influenced the field of endeavor;
- A plan describing how the person intends to continue the proposed work in the United States;
- A detailed business plan or other description, along with any relevant supporting evidence, when appropriate;
- Correspondence from prospective or potential employers, clients, or customers;
- Documentation reflecting feasible plans for financial support (see below for a more detailed discussion of evidence related to financing for entrepreneurs);
- Evidence that the person has received investment from U.S. investors, such as venture capital firms, angel investors, or start-up accelerators, and that the amounts are appropriate to the relevant endeavor;
- Copies of contracts, agreements, or licenses showing the potential impact of the proposed endeavor;
- Letters from government agencies or quasi-governmental entities in the United States demonstrating that the person is well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor;
- Evidence that the person has received awards or grants or other indications of relevant non-monetary support (for example, using facilities free of charge) from federal, state, or local government entities with expertise in economic development, research and development, or job creation; and
- Evidence demonstrating how the person’s work is being used by others, such as, but not limited to:
  - Contracts with companies using products that the person developed or assisted in developing;
  - Documents showing technology that the person invented, or contributed to inventing, and how others use that technology;
  - Patents or licenses for innovations the person developed with documentation showing why the patent or license is significant to the field.

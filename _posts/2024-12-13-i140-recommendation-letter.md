# Recommendation Letters for I-140 (NIW)

Letters of recommendations are not required by USCIS, but it is highly recommended to include 4-6 letters of recommendation for the following reasons:

## Why Recommendation Letters Are Important

1. **Demonstrating Expertise and Impact**  
   NIW applicants must show that their work is of substantial merit and national importance. Letters from experts in your field can provide evidence of your significant contributions and how your work benefits the U.S. or addresses critical national needs. A strong letter can validate your claims and enhance the credibility of your application.

2. **Supporting Your Claim of Uniqueness**  
   The NIW is designed for individuals who possess unique expertise or abilities critical to the U.S. national interest. Letters from respected professionals in your field can highlight what sets you apart, underscoring how your work is distinct and valuable.

3. **Demonstrating Recognition and Influence**  
   Letters help show that others in your field recognize the importance of your work. They can provide context about your influence, the significance of your projects, and your leadership in addressing issues that align with U.S. national interests.

4. **Establishing the Waiver Justification**  
   A key element of a NIW application is showing that your work benefits the U.S. to such an extent that it justifies waiving the usual requirement of a job offer or labor certification. Letters of recommendation can support this argument, helping to prove that your work will have a lasting impact on U.S. progress.

5. **Adding Credibility**  
   High-quality letters from respected professionals or academics lend additional credibility to your application, especially if the letter writers are well-known in their respective fields.

## Types of Recommenders

- **Subjective**: Someone who knows you personally, such as your PhD advisor, a professor you worked with, or executives from current or former jobs.  
- **Objective or Independent**: Someone who does not know you personally but is familiar with your work. These are more valuable than subjective recommenders.

## Basic Requirements for Recommendation Letters

- **Relevance**: Letters should come from people familiar with your work and its impact. Ideally, they should be written by experts with a credible reputation in the U.S.  
- **Specificity**: Provide concrete examples of your achievements and detail how your work aligns with U.S. national interests.  
- **Authority**: Letters from individuals with recognized authority in your field are particularly valuable.  
- **Clarity**: Clearly explain why your work is of national interest and how your qualifications meet the NIW criteria.

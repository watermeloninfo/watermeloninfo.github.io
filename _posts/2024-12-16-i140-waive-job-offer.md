# Waive Job Offer (NIW - Third Prong under Matter of Dhanasar)

To address the **third prong** of the National Interest Waiver (NIW) under *Matter of Dhanasar*, you must demonstrate that waiving the job offer and labor certification requirements will benefit the United States. Essentially, you need to argue that the national interest is better served by approving your petition without requiring a labor certification and a job offer.

## Key Objective

This prong, while the least important, still matters:
- Use language from the USCIS policy manual to strengthen your argument.
- If your field is STEM, emphasize it.

---

## Structure

### 1. Introduction
- Briefly explain why requiring a job offer and labor certification would hinder your ability to advance your proposed endeavor.
- Highlight why granting the waiver is in the national interest.

---

### 2. Explain Why a Labor Certification Is Inappropriate
- Demonstrate that the traditional labor certification process is unsuitable due to the nature of your work or field.
- Argue that your work is **not limited to a specific employer** or job position.
- Emphasize the broader societal or industry-wide impact of your work.
- Explain that requiring a labor certification would unnecessarily restrict your ability to engage in work that benefits the United States.

### 3. Highlight the Unique Nature of Your Contributions
- Explain how your skills and expertise make you uniquely qualified to advance your proposed endeavor.
- Argue that no other individual, including U.S. workers, can fulfill your role in advancing this work.
- Reference accomplishments, publications, awards, or recognition that prove your exceptional ability.
- Highlight the innovative or specialized nature of your contributions.

---

### 4. Demonstrate Broader U.S. Benefits
- Connect your ability to work freely (without being tied to a specific employer) to broader national benefits.
- Show how your contributions will impact U.S. goals, such as:
  - Economic growth
  - Public health
  - Scientific advancement

---

### 5. Reference Supporting Evidence
Cite specific exhibits to support your argument, such as:
- Letters of recommendation from experts emphasizing the critical nature of your work.
- Examples of how your work has already benefitted the U.S. and could not have been replicated by others.
- Government reports or data linking your work to national priorities.

---

### 6. Conclusion
- Summarize why waiving the job offer and labor certification requirements is in the national interest.
- Reiterate the broader benefits of your proposed endeavor.

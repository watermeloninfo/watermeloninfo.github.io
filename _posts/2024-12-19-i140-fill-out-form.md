The NIW (National Interest Waiver) is part of the **EB-2 employment-based immigrant visa category**. To qualify, you must demonstrate:

- Your work has substantial merit and national importance.
- You are well-positioned to advance the work.
- Waiving the job offer and labor certification is in the U.S. national interest.

## 2. Gather Necessary Documents

You will need evidence supporting your qualifications and your work's impact. Common documents include:

- **Degrees and transcripts** (e.g., advanced degrees or equivalent credentials).
- **Publications, citations, or awards** that demonstrate your expertise.
- **Letters of recommendation** from experts in your field.
- **Evidence of your work's impact** (e.g., reports, media coverage, or policy changes influenced by your work).

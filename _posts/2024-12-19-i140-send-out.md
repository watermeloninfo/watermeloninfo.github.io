# Sending Out the I-140 Application Package

The package should be neatly organized with all required forms and supporting documents. Use the following order:

### Cover Letter
- Include a list of all documents in the package.
- Briefly summarize your NIW eligibility and petition details.

### Form I-140
- Completed and signed.
- Include the $700 filing fee:
  - Check or money order payable to **"U.S. Department of Homeland Security"**.
  - Or use **Form G-1450** for credit card payments.

### Petition Letter
- A detailed argument for why you meet the NIW eligibility criteria.

### Supporting Documentation
- **Evidence of Substantial Merit and National Importance**:
  - Published research, patents, or other work demonstrating your field's significance.
- **Evidence You Are Well-Positioned to Advance the Work**:
  - Resume/CV, degrees, transcripts, recommendation letters, awards, and job history.
- **Evidence Supporting the National Interest**:
  - Documentation showing how your work benefits the U.S. and why it warrants a waiver of the labor certification.

## 2. Assemble the Package

- **Bind the documents**: Use binder clips, paperclips, or rubber bands. Avoid stapling large sections.
- **Label each section**: Use tabs or dividers for easy navigation (e.g., "Form I-140," "Evidence of National Importance").
- **Photocopy everything**: Keep a complete copy of your entire application for your records.

---

## 3. Address the Package

- Send the package to the correct **USCIS service center** based on your location and the filing type.
- **Double-check USCIS addresses**: Visit the [USCIS website](https://www.uscis.gov/i-140) and locate the filing address for Form I-140 under NIW.
- Use the specific mailing address for:
  - **USPS (regular mail)**, or
  - **FedEx/UPS/DHL (express/courier mail)**.

---

## 4. Send the Package

Choose a reliable delivery method to ensure safe and timely arrival:

- **Courier Services (Recommended)**: Use FedEx, UPS, or DHL for faster, trackable shipping.
- **USPS**: If you use USPS, send the package via **Priority Mail with tracking** or **Certified Mail with return receipt**.

---

## 5. Track Your Delivery

- Use the tracking number provided by your courier service or USPS to confirm that USCIS received the package.
- After USCIS processes your application, they will send you a **receipt notice (Form I-797)** with your case number.

---

## 6. Follow-Up

- If you submitted **Form G-1145**, you'll receive electronic updates.
- Use the receipt number on the [USCIS website](https://www.uscis.gov) to track your case status.
- Watch for **Requests for Evidence (RFEs)**, which USCIS might send if they need additional documentation.
